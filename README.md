Graphic demo
===

### Intro

Simple example of using d3 with crossfilter to create interactive charts web graphics and charts.

Intentionally crammed all code and data into index.html, so it can launch if ran locally, without a server.
Obviously, that is not a recommended approach within a server environment.

Open ./index.html and click on the graphics to change the context of other graphics.

TODO: Add a reset button..
